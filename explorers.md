##### What is an Explorer?

An explorer is a web based graphical tool, used to search for and view information stored on the blockchain ledger.  

When users interact with the Cardano network, whether that is by sending and receiving ada or delegating to a stake pool, these interactions are broadcast to the network in the form of transactions. A block producing node takes a number of these transactions, verifies their validity and then adds them to the tip of the chain in a new block.  

Blockchain explorers allow users to view these blocks and the included transactions, in addition to supplementary metadata. They present this data in a format that is human readable and accessible using a web browser.  

Cardano explorers commonly provide the following information:  
Epoch number  
Slot number  
Block number  
Transaction hashes  
Input and output values  
Timestamp  
Block producing node identifier  

Some explorers provide additional tools and information, such as API support, a list of the largest addresses by ada balance, and graphical visualisations of the blockchain's network activity.
