## Create a new Wallet

The steps below assume you have already [installed Yoroi](./install.md)

- [Create a Wallet on Yoroi extension or addon](#create-a-wallet-on-yoroi-extension-or-addon)
- [Adding or switching between wallets](#adding-or-switching-between-wallets)

### Create a Wallet on Yoroi extension or addon

Select `Create Wallet` on Yoroi Home page below:

![Home Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-community/support-faq/images/docs/images/yoroi-home.jpg)

Enter a Wallet name you would like to identify your wallet as. Also, you will need to type a 10-character password. This password will act as a second level protection and will be used to secure (by encrypting) your keys in cache. *To make any outgoing transfers - you will need this spending password.* Continue by clicking `Create Personal Wallet`

You will reach a security prompt asking you to **confirm** there is no one looking as the next stop will display your Wallet seed - which derives your [private keys](../../wallet.md#basics-about-private-keys). You would want to grab a paper and pen to write down the seed before continuing.

The page will ask you to now write down the 15 words recovery phrase displayed on screen. Please carefully write down and verify the words in the correct order before continuing. Often users tend to mix the order or rename few words for security, but forget to remember what was done.
**Important**: These words are the **only** way for you to have access to funds. You can lose your computer and have access to funds if you have these words, but if you lose the words - **no one can retrieve funds back for you**.

Now, you will be asked to verify the recovery phrase you've written down. Please select the words from the list in the same order as you saw them on screen before.

Once you've entered the 15 words, you will be shown a reminder about your recovery phrase. Please do *read* and then check the boxes to confirm:

This should land you to the following screen.

Congratulations! You have successfully created your Yoroi wallet.

### Adding or switching between wallets

Yoroi can handle multiple wallets.

If you're within a wallet view, you would see a pulldown at the top right corner, which should list your existing wallets as well as allow you to `Add new wallet`.

![Add Another Wallet from Wallet screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-community/support-faq/images/docs/images/yoroi-multiple-wallet-add.jpg)

If you're at `My Wallets` screen instead, you have the option to `Add new wallet` at the top.

![Add Another Wallet from My Wallets screen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-community/support-faq/images/docs/images/yoroi-multiple-wallet-add2.jpg)

In either cases, you will reach the screen below:

![Add new wallet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-community/support-faq/images/docs/images/yoroi-multiple-add-new-wallet.jpg)

You can continue the next steps as per [create wallet](#create-a-wallet-on-yoroi-extension-or-addon) instructions above.
